# Cell-Cell-Communication-Niche-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains code and workflows for performing niche analysis to study cell–cell communication in single-cell datasets

# Key Features:

Ligand–Receptor Interaction Analysis: Identification of active signaling interactions between sender and receiver cell types.

Cell-Type–Specific Signaling: Characterization of niche signals that regulate specific cell populations.

Condition-Specific Comparisons: Comparison of cell–cell communication networks across experimental conditions or disease states.

Pathway-Level Insights: Aggregation of ligand–receptor pairs into signaling pathways for biological interpretation.

Visualization: Network plots, heatmaps, dot plots, and chord diagrams to visualize intercellular communication.

Integration with scRNA-seq: Uses single-cell transcriptomic data and cell-type annotations as input.
